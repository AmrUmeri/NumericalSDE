We will present the theory of stochastic integration due to It\^o and discuss stochastic differential equations. We will present examples of such equations which can be solved analytically using the It\^o lemma. We will use the same lemma to construct numerical schemes for strong approximate solutions.
Then we will determine the convergence order of these schemes using simulations in the programming environment Python. 
Secondly, we will determine the convergence order analytically and give error bounds for our schemes.
We will end the thesis with the conclusion that our estimated convergence orders of our schemes match the theoretical convergence orders for the considered stochastic differential equations.
